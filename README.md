**SnapClicker** is a versatile automation tool that lets you record and replay mouse clicks and keyboard inputs with pinpoint accuracy. 
Whether you're automating repetitive tasks, building complex input sequences, or crafting custom workflows ‚Äî SnapClicker makes it easy. 
With a modern, user-friendly interface, you can save recordings as presets, manage them locally, and run them anytime with just a few clicks.

## ‚ú® Features
1. **Fast and Lightweight**
Utilizes the efficient `SendInput` API for simulating input ‚Äî significantly faster and more reliable than older methods like `keybd_event` or `mouse_event`.
2. **Smart Recording**
    * **Full Recording**: Record any sequence of mouse and keyboard inputs for playback.
    * **Manual Recording**: Capture an individual action with precise timestamps‚Äîideal for games and long-duration automation.
3. **PreciseDelays Mode**
   Enable high-precision timing for minimal delays between actions (microsecond-level control).
   
   > ‚ö†Ô∏èThis mode significantly increases CPU usage and system load. Only enable when absolutely necessary (e.g., competitive gaming, bypassing strict anti-bot checks).
   > For most tasks, standard delays are sufficient and far more efficient.

4. **Preset System**
Record your actions and save them as named presets. Easily organize and replay them whenever you need.

5. **Modern UI**
Sleek, intuitive interface that makes creating, managing, and running automations effortless.

6. **Wide Input Support**
Supports a variety of mouse actions ‚Äî including **left click**, **right click**, **middle click**, and **mouse movement**. For keyboards, it handles **nearly all keys**, allowing you to build robust, flexible workflows.

7. **Customizable Hotkeys**
Start and stop recording or playback using keyboard shortcuts. You can personalize these hotkeys to fit your workflow and preferences.

8. **Adjustable Action Intervals**
Customize the delay between each recorded action to control the speed and rhythm of playback. This feature is especially useful for bypassing anti-auto-clicking detection in certain applications or games.

## üíø Installation
### 1. Download from GitHub Releases
Go to the Latest [Release page](https://github.com/p6laris/SnapClicker/releases).
Download the setup file:
* SnapClicker-Setup.exe (installer)
* or SnapClicker-Portable.zip (no installation required)

Run the installer or extract the portable ZIP.

## üìñ Usage Manual

#### Standard Automation
For everyday tasks like data entry or repetitive clicking:
1. Keep `PreciseDelay` disabled
2. Set action interval to `0` for maximum speed
3. Record full automation sequences when possible

#### Precision Automation
For applications requiring exact timing:
1. Switch to manual recording mode
2. Set up individual actions
3. Configure custom intervals between actions
4. For `PreciseDelay` mode:
   - Enable only when absolutely necessary
   - Use minimum 5ms intervals
   - Monitor system resources
5. Test sequences in controlled environment first

### Recommended Settings
| Use Case          | Mode          | Interval | Notes                  |
|-------------------|---------------|----------|------------------------|
| General automation| Standard      | 0-1ms   | Balanced performance   |
| Critical timing  | PreciseDelay  | +5ms    | Short sessions only    |
